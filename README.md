# 🔥 Network Firewall Implementation

# 📌 Overview
This project is a Network Firewall implemented using Flask (Python) on Kali Linux with a React-based frontend. It provides an easy-to-use web interface for configuring and managing firewall rules, offering enhanced security and control over network traffic.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Web-Based UI – Configure firewall rules with an intuitive interface.\
✅ Rule Management – Add, remove, and modify firewall rules dynamically.\
✅ Traffic Monitoring – View real-time network activity logs.\
✅ Secure Backend – Implemented using Flask on Kali Linux, leveraging UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).\
✅ Platform Compatibility – Designed for Linux environments with a React-based frontend running on Windows (VS Code).

# 🛡️ Security Considerations
* Ensure the firewall rules are correctly configured to prevent unintended access.
* Run the backend with limited privileges to reduce security risks.
* Use HTTPS if deploying in a production environment.
